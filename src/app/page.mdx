import { HomeLayout } from "@/components/home-layout";


Hey, I’m Amil 👋

A full-stack developer building accessible, performant web & mobile apps with React, TypeScript, and Expo.

I love crafting seamless UI systems, dev tools, and experiences that feel great to use. I recently open-sourced [react-native-reanimated-chrono](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-native-reanimated-chrono) — a flexible timer/stopwatch UI built with Reanimated.

I’m currently building a quiz app focused on TypeScript and JavaScript fundamentals, with game-like interactions and clean architecture.

Curious how it’s going? <br />
🛠️ I share behind-the-scenes progress and thoughts in [my devlog](/devlog/quizcript).
