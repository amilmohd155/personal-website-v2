Hi 👋, my name is Moa. I write ✍🏼 about open source, programming, automation, and everything in between. You can check out [my blog posts here](/blog).


<br />

I interface between technical and non-technical audiences 📣, backend and frontend, infrastructure and design, policy and engineering.

I’m passionate about DX, simplifying infrastructure, and balancing functional rigor with world-class aesthetics. I’m also a keen [photographer](/photos) and seasoned project manager.

I’m currently working from Recife. If you’re around, reach out to me. Let’s meet for a coffee and get some work done together.

export default ({ children }) => <HomeLayout>{children}</HomeLayout>
