"Smile", the bride told to herself looking to the sad reflection on the mirror. The makeup room is empty now, few moments ago women of all ages crowded the room; women who were married and lived most of their lives for their spouses,and girls who were counting down their days before their own wedding.

Some of them were getting ready themselves while others were tending to the bride. The noise and chaos that ensued was too much for the bride and she furiously shouted at everyone to leave the room.

The sad reflection gazing back at her in the mirror is on the verge of tears. Outside the room, the auditorium is filling up with people and her groom is waiting for her, she barely knew the guy.

Decisions were taken, opinions were never asked. And here she sat, unable to protest. She looked again at the reflection and wiped the tears, stood up and walked to the door.
