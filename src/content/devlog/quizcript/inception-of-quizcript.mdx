A few months ago, I found myself preparing for a front-end developer interview. The role demanded solid knowledge in **TypeScript**, **React**, and **React Native** ‚Äî technologies I had already been working with for quite some time. But as with any serious opportunity, I wanted to refresh and reinforce my understanding, especially of the finer details I may have missed during regular development.

So I did what most of us do ‚Äî I searched for apps to practice technical quizzes. I was specifically looking for something that could challenge me in these three core areas: TypeScript, React, and React Native. But surprisingly, I couldn‚Äôt find anything satisfying. Most apps were either too generic, lacked depth, or focused only on JavaScript fundamentals. None of them were tailored to the technologies I actually use day-to-day.

That‚Äôs when the idea hit me.

**Why not build the app I wish existed?**

## **tsQuizX: The Prototype That Sparked the Vision**

I started scribbling down ideas. A minimal quiz app. Focused only on questions related to TypeScript and React-related ecosystems. I originally called it **tsQuizX** ‚Äî a working name, but it captured the essence of what I was trying to build: a TypeScript-focused quiz experience with an ‚ÄúX‚Äù factor for developers like me.

At this point, I wasn‚Äôt even thinking about shipping it publicly. It was more of a personal tool ‚Äî something I could tinker with, learn from, and use for my own prep. But the more I worked on it, the more I realized its potential. If I, as a developer, found this gap in the market, surely others would benefit from something similar.

## **Choosing Expo: My Go-To Stack**

When it came time to choose the tech stack, the answer was obvious ‚Äî **Expo**. I‚Äôve always been comfortable with React Native, but Expo in particular is where I‚Äôm most proficient. It allows for rapid iteration, easier testing across platforms, and a lot less boilerplate. Since this was a solo project and I wanted to focus on content and design rather than native configuration, Expo made perfect sense.

From the very first screen, I decided Quizcript (more on the name change soon) had to feel developer-friendly. Minimal UI, fast navigation, instant feedback, and of course ‚Äî clean, structured questions around real-world TypeScript and React use cases. I didn‚Äôt want the app to feel like a trivia game. I wanted it to feel like training.

## **Rebranding to Quizcript**

As the app evolved, so did its identity. The name **tsQuizX** felt too technical and temporary. I wanted a name that captured its spirit ‚Äî something snappy, memorable, and reflective of both ‚Äúquiz‚Äù and ‚Äúscript‚Äù (as in TypeScript).

And so, **Quizcript** was born.

A quiz app for developers who want to get better at writing scripts ‚Äî TypeScript, React components, and React Native views.

## **What‚Äôs Next?**

Quizcript is now growing into something I never initially planned ‚Äî a full-featured developer quiz companion with token-based challenge modes, performance tracking, and content updates. What began as a personal prep tool has turned into an ongoing project I‚Äôm genuinely proud of.

And it all started with a simple problem: I needed a better way to practice.


*If you‚Äôre a developer looking to level up your TypeScript, React, or React Native skills, Quizcript might just be the app you‚Äôve been looking for ‚Äî because it‚Äôs the one I was looking for too.* (Obviously, not yet üòâ but soon üöÄ)

This marks the beginning of a [**devlog**](/devlog/quizcript) series where I‚Äôll share the decisions I considered and the solutions I implemented while building Quizcript ‚Äî from architectural choices to edge-case handling. I‚Äôm hoping to write more blogs like this as the app evolves.
