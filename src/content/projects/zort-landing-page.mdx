Zort is a landing page for a fictional app, built to demonstrate my front-end skills using **Next.js**, **React**, and **Tailwind CSS**. The project focuses on responsive design and delivering a smooth user experience.

It was developed as part of an interview assignment for a company and is deployed on **Vercel** for fast and reliable hosting.
