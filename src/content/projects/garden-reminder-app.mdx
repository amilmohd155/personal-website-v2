This mobile app built with **React Native (Expo)** and designed to help users take better care of their plants. It allows users to schedule watering reminders, ensuring plants are consistently maintained over time. 

The app also integrates with the **Plant.id API**, enabling users to identify plants simply by uploading a photoâ€”making it easier to learn about and care for unfamiliar species. 

Developed using **TypeScript**, this app offers a clean and intuitive user experience while maintaining strong code quality and reliability.
