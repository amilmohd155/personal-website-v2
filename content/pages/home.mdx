Hey, I’m **Amil** 👋

A full-stack developer building accessible, performant web & mobile apps with `TypeScript`, `React` and `React Native`.

I love crafting seamless UI systems, developer tools, and experiences that feel great to use. I recently open-sourced [react-native-reanimated-timer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@docren/react-native-reanimated-timer) — a flexible timer and stopwatch UI built with Reanimated, and [react-native-markdown](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@docren/react-native-markdown) — a lightweight, extensible Markdown renderer for React Native.

I’m currently building a quiz app focused on TypeScript and JavaScript fundamentals, with game-like interactions and clean architecture.

Curious how it’s going? <br />
🛠️ I share behind-the-scenes progress and thoughts in [my devlog](/devlog/quizcript).
