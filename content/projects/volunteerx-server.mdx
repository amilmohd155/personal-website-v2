This project serves as the server-side foundation for **VolunteerX**, a localized social network designed to connect volunteers and changemakers tackling real-world challenges. 

Built with **Nest.js**, the server adopts a **microservice architecture** powered by **RabbitMQ** and **Apollo GraphQL Federation** for modular, scalable communication between services. It leverages **MongoDB** for data storage and **Neo4j** for managing complex social relationships and connections. 

The API is built with **Apollo GraphQL**, providing a flexible and efficient data layer to support the app's dynamic user experience.
