### Components

This package includes three core composable components:

- Timer : A countdown timer with customizable duration, animated progress, and seamless transitions.
- Stopwatch : A precise stopwatch with intuitive start, pause, and reset controls.
- Clock : A real-time animated clock synced to the system time.

### Composability

Each component exposes building-block primitives (e.g., Segments, Digits, and Labels) so you can compose your own time-based UIs with full control. Create custom layouts, transitions, or entirely new timer styles using the same performant foundation.

### Customization

Built with **NativeWind** support, every component accepts a className prop for effortless styling with Tailwind CSS — no need for inline styles or manual View composition. Props allow fine-grained control over animation, layout, and formatting, making integration seamless in any design system.

### Built for TypeScript

Written in TypeScript from the ground up, @docren/react-native-reanimated-timer provides full type safety, intelligent autocompletion, and an improved developer experience.

### Use Cases

Perfect for fitness apps, productivity tools, dashboards, or any project that needs animated time-based UI — combining performance, composability, and developer joy at its core.
