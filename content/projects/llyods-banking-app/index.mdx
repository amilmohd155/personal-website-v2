This project is a clone of the Lloyds Bank mobile app, built using **React Native**, **TypeScript**, and **Expo**. It includes core banking features such as user authentication, managing payees, viewing account details, making payments, and card management.

The interface is styled using **NativeWind**, with smooth transitions and interactions powered by **Reanimated**. The app is connected to an **Express.js** backend that handles authentication, account data, transactions, and payee management â€” providing a complete full-stack setup for simulating real-world banking functionality.
